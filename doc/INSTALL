First, cd to the src directory.

Run autoconf to build configure from configure.in

Then run configure to build Makefile from Makefile.in.

Now run "make" to build gnuchess.exe

Test it by typing

	./gnuchess.exe
	post
	depth 8
	go
	quit

You should see an 8-ply search. Most machines these
days should finish it within a minute or two. If not,
Control-C out, and do 

	depth 6
	go
	quit

instead.

If you got this far, congratulations.

Now it is time to compile the book. Do:

	ln -s ../book/book.pgn
	./gnuchess
	book create book.pgn
	quit

This will take a long, long time even on the fastest
machines. The book is quite large (180,000 master games).
If you don't want to wait (overnight), do this instead:

	head -30000 ../book/book.pgn > smallbook.pgn
	./gnuchess
	book create smallbook.pgn
	quit

This will make a much smaller book.
