The newsgroup gnu.chess and the mailing list info-gnu-chess@gnu.org
if  for the discussion of GNU Chess. It was created by Stuart Cracraft,
in the early 1980's prior to the renaming of Usenet's bulletin boards.

<P>gnu.chess and info-gnu-chess are not for general chess or computer chess
discussion.  You won't be flamed if you post such messages here, but you will
find more information in other places.  See topic <A
HREF="#[A.3]">[A.3]</A> below.

<P>PLEASE DO NOT try to start or play chess games by posting messages to
gnu.chess.  Instead, read the rec.games.chess FAQ 
(see topic <A HREF="#[A.3]">[A.3]</A>)
to learn about the IECG, the
IECC, and other groups that you can join to find opponents, and send one or
more of them email to join.

<P>The newsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed bidirectionally; that is,
any article posted on the newsgroup is automatically forwarded to the
mailing list, and any mail sent to the list is automatically forwarded
to the newsgroup.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[A.2]">[A.2] How do I subscribe or unsubscribe?</A></H3>

The simplest way is to either choose to read gnu.chess in your newsreader, or
choose not to.

<P>If you want to be added to or deleted from the mailing list, mail to
info-gnu-chess-request@gnu.org (not to the list or newsgroup itself).

software?</A></H3>

As a shortcut to most things mentioned in this FAQ, try my Chess Web page,
<A HREF=
"http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Tim_Mann/chess.html"
>http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Tim_Mann/chess.html</A>.
My Web page is the best place to get the latest versions of XBoard and
WinBoard
and the most up-to-date version of this FAQ.

<P>For general news and information about chess, try the newsgroup hierarchy
rec.games.chess.*, especially the groups rec.games.chess.misc and
rec.games.chess.computer.  Both of the latter groups have very informative
FAQs maintained by Steve Pribut; look for them on the newsgroups or at
<A HREF=
"http://www.clark.net/pub/pribut/chess.html"
>http://www.clark.net/pub/pribut/chess.html</A>.

<P>Like other GNU software, you can get GNU Chess, XBoard, and
WinBoard by anonymous FTP from 
<A HREF=
"ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/"
>ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/</A>
and its many mirror sites.  Look in the subdirectories chess
xboard, and winboard.
The .tar.gz suffix on the files there indicates they were packed with tar
and compressed with gzip.  The .exe or .zip suffixes indicate files that
were packed and compressed with zip.

<P>For other chess software, try the Internet Chess Library.  Use anonymous
FTP
to connect to ftp.freechess.org, or go to the Web page
<A HREF=
"http://www.freechess.org/"
>http://www.freechess.org/</A>.
You can get chess software, game
collections, the FAQ file for rec.games.chess, and other chess-related
material there, in the directory pub/chess.  The FTP server can
automatically decompress files for you as you download them, useful if you
don't have gzip.

<P>Here is a sample anonymous ftp session.  Some of the ftp server's responses
are abbreviated, but all the commands you must type are included.

Stuart Cracraft founded the GNU Chess project the year GNU was
started. Having collaborated with Richard Stallman before GNU when they
introduced the self-learning EMACS editor tutorial. When GNU started,
Stuart felt the GNU project needed a good mascot, akin to the team's
dog at a football game.
He worked with Richard to introduce the GNU Mascot
mutt (GNU Chess) to the world. Since then, GNU has snarled its way
up the rating latter and now sports a senior master rating at the 
Free Internet Chess server when run on modern computer hardware
(as of the time of this writing the development machine is a 1.5GHz
Pentium 4.)
Chua Kong-Sian of the Singapore Supercomputing Center is the primary
author of GNU Chess version 5. He based GNU Chess 5's
move generator on an article by Stuart in the ICCA Journal 1984.
We are indirecty indebted to Dr. Robert Hyatt of the University of
Alabama at Birmingham for feedback over the years.
All development on the 4.x series, including the native-PC
standalone version, was stopped as of 10/10/99 (but note
that it runs anyway on a PC under WinBoard.)
Bug-fixes or email regarding 4.x series will be politely
returned to sender with a request to use 5.x instead. 4.x is
not supported officially or unofficially by
the Free Software Foundation now or in the future.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[A.6]">[A.6] How do I report bugs, offer help, etc.?</A></H3>

Any time you want to report a possible bug in GNU Chess, I 
need to know exactly what commands you ran and what output you
error messages you. I will not do your debugging or work for you
but will fix authentic bugs.

<P>If you are using Unix, run the "script" program, run XBoard with
the -debug flag (if you get as far as running it), do whatever is
necessary to reproduce the problem, type "exit" to the shell, and mail
us the resulting typescript file.  We also need to know what
hardware/operating system combination you are using.  The command
"uname -a" will usually tell you this; include its output in your
typescript.

<P>If you are using MS Windows, run WinBoard with the -debug flag, and
send us a copy of the WinBoard.debug file.  If you aren't sure how to
add command-line flags to WinBoard, you can hit Ctrl+Alt+F12 to create
a WinBoard.debug file after WinBoard starts, but that is not as good,
because a few messages that would have been printed at the start are
lost.

<p>Either way, please send me the exact text of the commands you typed
and the output you got, not just your recollection of approximately
what they were.  The messages may seem meaningless to you, but they
are very meaningful to us and essential for diagnosing problems.

<P>You should be able to contact all the members of the project by sending
mail
to bug-gnu-chess@gnu.org.  If you don't trust this list, you can send
mail about this FAQ to Stuart Cracraft (cracraft@gnu.org); but send mail about
XBoard or WinBoard to Tim Mann (mann@pa.dec.com); and finally please
send mail about cmail to Evan Welsh (R.E.Welsh@quadstone.co.uk).
Comments that are of interest to all users of the software should be posted 
to the gnu.chess newsgroup.

<H3><A NAME="[B.1]">[B.1] What is GNU Chess?</A></H3>

GNU Chess is a free chess-playing program developed as part of the GNU project
of the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

<P>GNU Chess is a communal chess program.  Contributors donate their time and
effort in order to make it a stronger, better, sleeker program.  Contributions
take many forms: interfaces to high-resolution displays, opening book
treatises, speedups of the underlying algorithms, additions of extra
heuristics.  These contributions are then distributed to the large user-base
so that all may enjoy the fruits of our labor.

<P>GNU Chess is intended to run under Unix or Unix-compatible systems.  It is
written in C and should be portable to other systems.

<P>For a test drive of the previous version, try WebChess, a World Wide
Web interface provided by DJ Delorie.  The URL is 
<A HREF=

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[B.2]">[B.2] What is GNU Chess's rating?</A></H3>

It would be irresponsible to answer this question with a number, without first
explaining a few things about ratings.

<P>The ratings that are commonly given for computer chess players are less
meaningful than they may seem.  Most computer chess players (including GNU
Chess) do not play in tournaments against humans, or do so only rarely, so
they do not have official ratings from FIDE, USCF, or other chess
organizations.

<P>Some people have methods for rating chess programs approximately by giving
them a set of problems to work on and seeing how they do, or by having them
play tournaments against each other.  Any rating number produced by such
means should be taken with a grain of salt; it may be only a rough
approximation to the rating the program would achieve in over-the-board
tournament competition against humans.  The chess skills required for solving
problems or playing against other computers are not necessarily the same as
those required for play against humans.  Also, of course, tournaments among
computers can rate the computers only relative to one another, not relative to
humans.  Some of the computers need to be rated by other means to give the
ratings a basis to start from.

<P>Compared with human players, computer players are strong tactically but
weak
strategically, and are much better at blitz chess than at slow chess.  These
differences make it more difficult to assign a meaningful rating too.

<P>Several computers do play regularly on the Internet chess servers and have
achieved ratings there.  These ratings have the advantage of being based on
many games.  On the other hand, ICS ratings are only roughly comparable to
USCF or FIDE ratings.  Many players have ICS ratings that are hundreds of
points higher or lower than their USCF or FIDE ratings.

<P>Finally, unlike dedicated chess machines, or PC chess programs that run on
only a few different models of Intel processors, GNU Chess runs on many
different kinds of CPU at many different speeds.  Thus its strength depends on
how fast a machine you run it on and how much optimization your C compiler
does.  Some people have formulas for estimating how a computer player's rating
varies on faster or slower machines---see the rec.games.chess FAQ for more
information---but these need to be taken with a grain of salt too.

<P>All that said, here are some numbers.

<P>- On Internet Chess Club (www.chessclub.com/finger/gnuchess),
GNU Chess, running on a dual-cpu 800mhz Pentium 3 with only one 
processor fully dedicated to GNU sports a lightning rating of 2601,
a blitz rating of 2587 and a standard rting of 2349.
On the Free Internet Chess Server (freechess.org), GNU Chess
running on a 1.0 Ghz Pentium 4 sports a rating a couple hundred
points lower due to the rating inflation at ICC and the relative
deflation at FICS.\
<HR>

<P><i>GNU Chess 5</i> provides full capability on a PC. In fact,
it was jointly developed on a PC running Windows 95 and on a GNU/Linux system
with full graphical capabilities (mouse to move pieces, etc.)
Obtain full code, with copyleft, at
<A HREF=
"http://www.gnu.org"
>http://www.gnu.org</A>.
And remember, you must share your improvements. You are not
permitted, legally, to hoard them.  You must share.

<P>Porting GNU software to PCs is not a focus of the GNU
project, and these ports are not supported by the FSF. However,
you should know that the development machine for GNU Chess is
(currently) a 1.5Mhz Pentium 4 running Windows Millenium so
I am not personally adverse to Microsoft.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[B.3]">[B.3] How do I build GNU Chess?  Do I need gcc?</A></H3>

The first step to building GNU Chess is to get the distribution file and
unpack it.  See above.

<P>To unpack the GNU Chess distribution, chess-*.tar.gz, put it into a new,
empty directory, cd there, and give this Unix command:

<PRE>
    gzip -cd chess-*.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
</PRE>

If this command fails because you don't have gzip, see topic <A
HREF="#[A.3]">[A.3]</A>, and ask a local Unix expert if you need more
help.

<P>The above command will unpack all the files into a new directory.  Next, cd
into this new directory.  

<P>Decide what directory tree you are going to install GNU Chess in.
The default is /usr/local.  If you have write access to this directory
tree, make sure that it contains subdirectories bin, lib, and man.
(If you must "su" to get write access to /usr/local, you don't need to
do so until just before the "make install" below.)  Type the
following:

<PRE>
    autoconf
    configure
    make
    make install
</PRE>

If you do not have autoconf, get it from www.gnu.org (/pub/gnu/autoconf).
autoconf builds configure which then builds make. Please don't "wing" it
by bypassing autoconf nor configure. Get the proper tools.

If you are going to install GNU Chess under your home directory for personal
use, do this instead:

<PRE>
    mkdir $HOME/bin $HOME/lib $HOME/man
    configure --prefix=$HOME
    make
    make install
</PRE>

If you have problems or special requirements, see the files README, INSTALL,
Makefile.in, and configure.in for more information.

<P>You must have GNU CC (gcc) to build GNU Chess or at least a compiler that
has the equivalent of GNU CC's "long long", a 64-bit datatype (see common.h
in the distribution for the datatype.)
