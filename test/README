TEST DATA

These datasets are for testing purposes, and should not be included
in the distribution of GNUchess. They (and others) are freely available
at http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Launchpad/2640/pgn/tests/

The command to test is "solve filename". Previously issue the
command "book off", and set hashsize and other settings to
avoid undue variability.

Other system activity can distort test results. 
Variations of the order of 1% are common.
