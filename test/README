TEST DATA

These datasets are for testing purposes, and should not be included
in the distribution of GNUchess. They (and others) are freely available
at http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Launchpad/2640/pgn/tests/

The command to test is "solve filename". Previously issue the
command "book off", and set hashsize and other settings to
avoid undue variability.

Other system activity can distort test results. 
Variations of the order of 1% are common.

2003/06/16 SRW, benchmark for future reference.
GNU Chess 5.07 development version.
GCC version 2.95.4 Debian Pre-release
Celeron (Coppermine) 547.19MHz 1091.17 bogomips

Test		Score	Nodes Examined
BT2630.epd	12/30	21987342
endgame.epd	15/46	53994637
wac.epd		275/300 171065732

2003/06/18 Add wacfailed.epd selection of "difficult" wac positions.
Noted that 5/24 of these are solved on same hardware with "hash off".
Hashing is a mixed blessing at fast time scales, as it slows the 
search slightly.
