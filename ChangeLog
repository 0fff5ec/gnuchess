2002-08-01  Simon Waters <simon@wretched.demon.co.uk>

	* Correct additional input file name limits
	  and related field sizes throughout code.
	  (NB UNIVERSIAL code changes untested)

2002-05-19  Simon Waters <simon@wretched.demon.co.uk>

	* Corrected command line size to 128 through out cmd.c to
	  fix segmentation fault errors on complex fen positions.

2002-05-02  Simon Waters <simon@wretched.demon.co.uk>

	* Reorder move generation of promotions

	* Improve sorting of captures in SortMove

	* Insert pinned and hanging piece checks

	* Remove unreachable code in cmd.c

	* Update some eval weightings

2002-03-14  Simon Waters <simon@wretched.demon.co.uk>

	* Fix memory leak HashTab

2002-03-06  Simon Waters <simon@wretched.demon.co.uk>

	* Make "book on" use BOOKPREFER not BOOKBEST

	* Fix implementation of BOOKBEST

	* Implement "book {worst|best|prefer}"

	* Correct README as it said not Official distro

2002-03-05  Simon Waters <simon@wretched.demon.co.uk>

	* Remove redundant tests from configure.ac

	* Update version to 5.04 in configure.ac

	* Move local m4 macros to acinclude.m4

2002-03-03  Lukas Geyer  <geyer@math.uni-dortmund.de>

	* common.h: Refine check for buggy gcc 2.95 on PPC.

	* common.h: Changed lzArray and BitCount from short to unsigned
	  char, corresponding prototypes for leadz() and nbits(), too.

	* inlines.h and util.c: Changed leadz() and nbits() to not use
	  union, rather do explicit bit arithmetic which does not assume
	  anything on endianness.

	* test.c: Changed all timings to floating point and higher
	  precision.

2002-03-03  Simon Waters <simon@wretched.demon.co.uk>

	* Added unknown protocol commands to
	  avoid "Illegal move: <unknown command>"

	* sd synonym for depth

	* Added approximate st and additional errors for xboard
	  suggested by Tim Mann

	* Added basic "hint" feature, by extracting next
	  move from PV in hash. Doesn't work in book.

2002-03-02  Simon Waters <simon@wretched.demon.co.uk>

	* Modified code to print "Illegal move: cmd" when
	  an illegal move or unknown command is entered.

2002-02-26  Simon Waters <simon@wretched.demon.co.uk>

	* Hacked version of ac_need_stdint_h AC macro to fix Win32 build

GNU Chess 5.03 Released

2002-02-12  Simon Waters <simon@wretched.demon.co.uk>

	* Fix bug with saving move after mate in PGN files

2002-02-09  Lukas Geyer  <geyer@math.uni-dortmund.de>

	* book.c: Checked for calloc() failure to return BOOK_ENOMEM
	in BookBuilderOpen().

	* iterate.c: Changed search time calculation to a very
	non-aggressive strategy (keep always 2 seconds for possible
	delays). Added SearchRoot() if we fail low. This should fix
	the illegal move problem, which occurred exactly when we
	failed low for all depths.

2002-02-08  Lukas Geyer  <geyer@math.uni-dortmund.de>

	* Changes mainly to book.c in order to have
	dynamically allocated book hashes. Changed the
	binary book format once more.

2002-02-07  Simon Waters <simon@wretched.demon.co.uk>

	* Moved Lukas's version into CVS

	* Adjusted version string to 5.03

	* Reimplemented bk in better fashion

	* Added self to authors file


2002-02-06  Lukas Geyer  <geyer@math.uni-dortmund.de>

	* Clean-ups to make it build with the Sun cc compiler.

	* moved leadz() and nbits() to inlines.h, so that they will
	really be inlined. Left the original versions in util.c,
	so that one can define NO_INLINE to get the functions
	exported. Speed gain is quite significant on Linux/PPC.

2002-02-05  Lukas Geyer  <geyer@math.uni-dortmund.de>

	* Fixed a nasty bug in buf_to_book() which would add position
	evaluations to all the hash-collision positions while traversing
	the list. As collisions are not very frequent, this would
	generate slightly wrong books which could lead to infrequent
	strange opening blunders.

	* Abstracted hash handling functions in book.c into macros,
	implemented secondary hash traversal.

2002-02-04  Lukas Geyer  <geyer@math.uni-dortmund.de>

	* Removed index from binary book file, continued fixing book
	building. (It used to take only the white moves if two players
	from the list were playing each other.)

	* Added return codes to function in book.c.

2002-02-03  Lukas Geyer  <geyer@math.uni-dortmund.de>

	* Killed some bugs related to endianness and padding in
	book.c. Rewrote README to reflect reality more closely. Split
	BookBuilderOpen() from BookBuilder().

2002-02-02  Lukas Geyer  <geyer@math.uni-dortmund.de>

	* Cleaned up some types, converted them to explicit ones uint32_t,
	uint16_t and uint64_t. Should fix the bug that hashes generated on
	64 bit machines were different. Thanks to Goswin Brederlow
	<goswin.brederlow@student.uni-tuebingen.de> for this one.

	* Fixed a documentation bug (replaced "book compile" by "book
	add")

	* Added readline support

	* Added TODO
	
2002-01-30  Lukas Geyer  <geyer@math.uni-dortmund.de>

	* Redesigned the build system to use automake. Cleaned up code,
	fixed SETBIT /CLEANBIT for gcc 2.95 on Linux/PPC. (Actually,
	gnuchess hits a gcc optimization bug here, congratulations...)
	
	* Added help functionality. Still ugly, but informative. (And the
	plain gnuchess interface _is_ the definition of ugliness anyway.)
