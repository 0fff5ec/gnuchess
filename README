This version of gnuchess is based on the current CVS tree,
available on 

http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/chess/

It is NOT by any means an official distribution tree of gnuchess.

I started hacking on gnuchess because it would not work on Linux/PPC
with gcc 2.95 at optimization level -O2. In fact, it hit an
optimization bug of gcc (which is fixed in gcc 3.0). This patched
version should work with any gcc. Further changes include a
fundamental change in the book building algorithm which makes it some
orders of magnitude faster (so now you can really build a book out of
this huge book.pgn without waiting for a week), an implementation of
the help function, readline support etc. 

Special thanks for help and patches go out to Goswin Brederlow.

The original documentation is available in doc/README, a more detailed
description of the changes I made is in ChangeLog. I try to keep an
up-to-date version in

If you find any bugs, please also drop me a note.
