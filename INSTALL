The usual procedure should apply. After you have unpacked
the sources, type (in the sources top-level directory)

	./configure
	make

You may also pass several other options such as compiler options
to configure, just type ./configure --help for advice. In particular,
you may experiment with compiler optimization flags, which are added
easily as (assuming you have a bourne-type shell)

CFLAGS="-O3 -ffast-math" ./configure

The build should work with gcc, it also works with the Sun Workshop
compiler and maybe others.

Test gnuchess by typing

	./gnuchess.exe (or ./gnuchess on Linux/Unix)
	post
	depth 8
	go
	quit

You should see an 8-ply search. Most machines these
days should finish it within a minute or two. If not,
Control-C out, and do 

	depth 6
	go
	quit

instead.

If you got this far, congratulations.

If you want to install the software in some global directory,
by default /usr/local, become root and type

	make install

If you want to install the sources in some other directory
than /usr/local, replace the first line by

	./configure --prefix=/my/favourite/dir 

You can build an opening book which may enhance the value
of gnuchess quite a lot. In order to do so, get the opening
book from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/chess/book_1.00.pgn.gz.
Unpack it with gunzip, run gnuchess and type the following.

	book add book.pgn
	quit

This will take some time, even on fast machines. 
If you are impatient, do this instead:

	head -30000 book.pgn > smallbook.pgn

Then run gnuchess and type

	book add smallbook.pgn
	quit

This will make a much smaller book.
