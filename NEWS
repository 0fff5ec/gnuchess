New in gnuchess 5.05:

- Security fixes: Fixed potential buffer overflows in pgn.c and epd.c.
- The opening book book.dat can now be in the working directory,
  /usr/share/games/gnuchess/ or /usr/lib/games/gnuchess/. The first
  of these directories which contains a valid book.dat is chosen.
- Changes for easing compilation with MSVC

[ Could we rewrite history for the older versions, too? I like to
  have NEWS give a quick overview of what has changed between versions,
  only user-visible stuff. That is the recommended purpose of NEWS. 
  However, the following is not yet accurate and complete. ]

New in gnuchess 5.04:
- Bug fixes (as always)
- ???

New in gnuchess 5.03:
- Bug fixes (The infamous "illegal move" bug should be dead by now.)
- Architecture independent binary book. Yes, you may now move your
  binary book around between little and big endian, 32 and 64 bit
  machines and it should not break. 
- Build system is now automake/autoconf, should ease porting gnuchess
  to your favorite strange architecture. (Hell, what about gnuchess on
  cellphones...?)
