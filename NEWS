* Changed format of book.dat again, now takes less disk space. 
  However, one bug used to cause the book building algorithm to
  neglect a lot of positions which it was supposed to look at, so this
  leads to more book entries with the same PGN files now.

* Added some performance tweaks, should really run faster now.

* We now have a portable binary format for the opening book.
  Furthermore, the hash values should now be the same on 64bit
  machines. (Was different before.)

* Converted build system to automake, cleaned up code, in particular
  counter a nasty gcc optimization bug on PPC architecture.
