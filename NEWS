New in gnuchess 5.05:

- Security fixes: Fixed potential buffer overflows in pgn.c and epd.c.
- The opening book book.dat can now be in the working directory,
  /usr/share/games/gnuchess/ or /usr/lib/games/gnuchess/. The first
  of these directories which contains a valid book.dat is chosen.
- Changes for easing compilation with MSVC
- The support for Novag Universal board was removed from code
- Numerous bug fixes, and minor enhancements to algorithmns

New in gnuchess 5.04:
- Bug fixes (as always)
- Hint feature implemented using ht
- Book command now has options "worst", "best" ,"prefer".

New in gnuchess 5.03:
- Bug fixes (The infamous "illegal move" bug should be dead by now.)
- Architecture independent binary book. Yes, you may now move your
  binary book around between little and big endian, 32 and 64 bit
  machines and it should not break. 
- Build system is now automake/autoconf, should ease porting gnuchess
  to your favorite strange architecture. (Hell, what about gnuchess on
  cellphones...?)
